# Climate-Change-on-Tiger-Shark-Migration

## Project Overview:
This project explores the effects of climate change on the migration patterns of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in the Atlantic Ocean. By analyzing satellite tracking data, we aim to identify how ocean warming influences the timing, routes, and behavior of these apex predators.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains satellite tracking information of tiger sharks, including:
- Latitude: Geographic north-south position of shark tracking points.
- Longitude: Geographic east-west position of shark tracking points.
- Season: Classification of tracking data into warm or cold seasons.
- Month: Specific month of the year when tracking occurred.
- Year: The year in which the data was recorded.

## Key Findings:
Tiger sharks exhibit broad migration patterns across the Atlantic Ocean, with some extreme outliers in longitude.
Seasonal and annual shifts in migration are evident, potentially linked to changing environmental conditions.
Further analysis is needed to correlate migration changes with rising ocean temperatures.
